# Final Assignment Commentary

For this course's final, I opted for a Github pages site made with HTML because I think it is the one tool I need more practice with.
Other tools such as Oxygen, LibreOffice, DITA, etc. are more straightforward, and I was able to get comfortable with them quite qickly, with HTML instead, it's still a learning curve, and will probably be for a long time. 

For example, to complete the assignment I learned how to create a functional navigation bar to include the different pages required. 

Creating the CSS style guide took a very long time, and I had to go back and forth to it multiple times as I included more sections per page. However, I still found it very enjoyable to see how different styles affected the look of the page.
